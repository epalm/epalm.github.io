      <description>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Eric, a software developer living near Toronto, Canada. I&amp;rsquo;ll mostly be using this blog to write tutorials about code I find useful and/or interesting.
If you find any errors in my posts, or just want to talk about their contents, you can get in touch with me on Twitter. I&amp;rsquo;m also on StackOverflow, GitHub, BitBucket, and KeyBase.</description>

 Create a message on a Linux server. Some time later, read the message on a Windows computer. Be pretty darn sure the message hadn&amp;rsquo;t been tampered with.  Public-key cryptography (aka asymmetric cryptography) to the rescue! Paraphrasing Wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s definition, public-key cryptography is a system that uses pairs of keys: public keys which may be shared widely, and private keys which are known only to the owner.</description>
